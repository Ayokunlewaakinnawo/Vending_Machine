# Vending_Machine
The program is designed for a vending machine to dispense change.

Developing a program which will be used by a vending machine to dispense change. The cost of the item can be any amount up to five dollars and we will assume that the machine accepts any dollar bills denomination and returns change using the highest form of currency first, the dollar bill, followed by quarters then dimes, then nickels, and finally pennies. if the amount entered is less than cost of the item selected for vending, “Insert More Money” would be displayed. otherwise, dispense correct change.
